	<b>Bluebird</b>

	there's a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I'm too tough for him,
	I say, stay in there, I'm not going
	to let anybody see
	you.
	there's a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
	cigarette smoke
	and the whores and the bartenders
	and the grocery clerks
	never know that
	he's
	in there.

	there's a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I'm too tough for him,
	I say,
	stay down, do you want to mess
	me up? 
	you want to screw up the
	works? 
	you want to blow my book sales in
	Europe? 
	there's a bluebird in my heart that
	wants to get out
	but I'm too clever, I only let him out
	at night sometimes
	when everybody's asleep.
	I say, I know that you're there,
	so don't be
	sad.
	then I put him back,
	but he's singing a little
	in there, I haven't quite let him
	die
	and we sleep together like
	that
	with our
	secret pact
	and it's nice enough to
	make a man
	weep, but I don't
	weep, do
	you?

	<b>here I am</b>

	drunk at 3 a.m. at the bottom of my 
	2nd bottle
	of wine, I have typed from a dozen to 
	15 pages of poesy
	an old man
	maddened for the flesh of young girls 
	in this
	dwindling twilight
	liver gone
	kidneys going
	pancreas pooped
	top-floor blood pressure

	while the fear of wasted years
	laughs between my toes
	     
	no woman will live with me
	no Florence Nightingale to watch
	over me.

	if I have a stroke I will lay here 
	for six days, 
	my three cats hungrily ripping the 
	flesh
	from my legs, wrists, head

	the radio playing classical music.

	I promised myself never to write 
	old man poems
	but this one's funny, you see, 
	excusable, be-
	cause there's
	still more left
	here at 3 a.m. and I am going to take 
	this sheet from
	the typer
	pour another glass and
	insert another
	make love to the fresh new whiteness

	maybe get lucky
	again

	first for
	me

	later
	for you.
